# containerization-of-any-php-application-docker
Any PHP application (we focused mainly on laravel) can be connected to containerized mysql. We will be able to run NPM, composer, and artisan commands. All of these services(npm, composer, and artisan) run as a seperate docker containers and serve the application.
